    <h1>All about Cowrie</h1>
    <p>
      Cowrie uses NYC Open Data to give you guide of MBE-certified Latinx- and
      Black-owned businesses in New York City.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is New York City without if not Caribbean bakeries, Harlem street
      vendors, soul food, and bot√°nicas? From small side-hustles to storefronts
      to multi-million dollar businesses, Cowrie lets Hispanic and Black
      entrepreneurs shine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2007 and 2012, it is estimated that over 30% of our city's
      black-owned businesses have vanished. Both Hispanic and Black communities
      struggle to stay in the neighborhoods in which they once thrived. It is
      more crucial than ever to support the businesses that make our city
      diverse, vibrant and rich.
